Dynu for [`libdns`](https://github.com/libdns/libdns)
=======================

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/test.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/libdns/dynu)

This package implements the [libdns interfaces](https://github.com/libdns/libdns) for Dynu, allowing you to manage DNS records.

## Authenticating

This package uses **API Token authentication**. Refer to the [Dynu documentation](https://www.dynu.com/Support/API) for more information.

Start by retrieving your API token (API-Key) from the [table on the API Credentials page](https://www.dynu.com/ControlPanel/APICredentials) to be able to make authenticated requests to the API.

## OwnDomain field

The field OwnDomain was added to support the Caddy DNS module use case where the DNS zone (e.g. dynu.com) is different from your own (sub)domain in Dynu (e.g. my.dynu.com). Just set it to the root domain in Dynu API, e.g. domainName in the response of /dns/getroot/{hostname} call.

## Tests

Several tests for the basic functionality of the real Dynu API are available. These tests are not run by default. Set the environment variables TEST_ZONE and TEST_API_TOKEN to enable the tests like so:

```
TEST_ZONE=example.com. TEST_API_TOKEN=dynu_api_token go test -v
```

If the tests fail, you can manually check and fix the DNS records on the [DDNS Services page](https://www.dynu.com/en-US/ControlPanel/DDNS).
